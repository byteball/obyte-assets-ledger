# Server app for Obyte Assets Ledger

Obyte Headless Wallet with REST JSON API

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Testnet
Run `cp .env.testnet .env` to connect to TESTNET hub. Backup and delete the database if you already ran it on MAINNET. Wallet app for [TESTNET can be downloaded from Obyte.org](https://obyte.org/testnet) website.

## Configuration & data folder
The default configuration are loaded from conf.js files of dependencies ([ocore](https://github.com/byteball/ocore/blob/master/conf.js) and [headless-obyte](https://github.com/byteball/headless-obyte/blob/master/conf.js)), and then override by this project's [conf.js](./conf.js) file. By default, headless wallet will be light node on testnet and full node on mainnet, same with encryption of private keys - no passphrase on testnet, but passphrase on mainnet. This can also be overridden in conf.json file that will be created in data folder (`./config/obyte-assets-ledger/conf.json` on Linux). Here is the example of conf.json (use without commments):
```javascript
{
	"bLight": true, // light node only keeps data related to headless wallet, full node gets all data and is faster
	"hub": "relay.bytes.cash/bb", // peer to connect to (light node: gets data from, full node: finds initial peers from)
	"bNoPassphrase": false, // forces to set private key encryption
	"payout_address": "", // can be used to withdraw all Bytes or manually consolidate Bytes to 1st address (if empty)
	"allowedExternalAssets": [], // array of additional asset IDs to allow to be moves between accounts
	"smtpTransport": "relay", // default is "local" to use sendmail
	"smtpRelay": "smtp.mailtrap.io", // used only when smtpTransport is "relay"
	"smtpUser": "MAILTRAP_INBOX_USER", // used only when smtpTransport is "relay"
	"smtpPassword": "MAILTRAP_INBOX_PASSWORD", // used only when smtpTransport is "relay"
	"smtpSsl": false, // used only when smtpTransport is "relay"
	"smtpPort": 2525, // used only when smtpTransport is "relay"
	"from_email": "test@example.com", // email address to send notification from
	"admin_email": "test@example.com", // email address where to send check_daemon.js notifications
	"socksHost": "127.0.0.1", // TOR proxy address
	"socksPort": 9050 // port for TOR proxy
}
```

## Start the app
```bash
node server.js
```
and type the passphrase and press ENTER, if prompted.

## Asset metadata registration
All assets need to be issued in their smallest unit amounts. In order to have decimals, you will need to use `10 to a power of decimals` amount of tokens (for example, 10**8 for Bitcoin equivalent). You can register the asset ticker, decimals and description on [Obyte Token Registry](https://tokens.ooo/) (there is [testnet Token Registry](https://testnet.tokens.ooo/) too), so the asset could be properly shown in Obyte GUI wallet app and Obyte DAG explorers. Read more about [Token Registry on Obyte blog](https://blog.obyte.org/whats-next-for-obyte-decentralized-token-registry-b87d455deeea).

## Maintenance
Bytes are already consolidated from all addresses to first change address, but custom assets need to be consolidated per address basis.

Run this command in crontab every 15 minutes to consolidate UTXOs of first change address or run manually when needed (over 100 UTXOs) for any other address:
```bash
curl -s 'http://localhost:8081/transfer/consolidate' -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw '{"asset":"ASSET_ID","address":"CHANGE_ADDRESS"}'
```

## Asset statistics
Statistic about each token can be queried from [Stats endpoint](https://natalie-seltzer.gitbook.io/obytetokens/totals). Here are their meanings:
* **Tokens in merchant wallet:** `tokensOnChangeAddress`
* **Tokens in clients wallets:** `tokensOnOtherAddresses`
* **Tokens in external wallets:** `tokensOnExternalAddreses`
* **Tokens issued:** `tokensIssued`
* **Tokens burned:** `tokensOnFirstAddress`
* **Total supply:** `tokensIssued-tokensOnFirstAddress`
* **Circulating supply:** `tokensIssued-tokensOnFirstAddress-tokensOnChangeAddress`

Coin listing websites require machine readable Total Supply and Circulating Supply, it is recommended to make these 2 numbers (with correct amount of decimals) available at `DOMAINNAME/total_supply.txt` and `DOMAINNAME/circulating_supply.txt`.
